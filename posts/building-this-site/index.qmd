## Why Quarto?

I originally hosted my CV as a simple Markdown page on GitHub Pages using the Jekyll Cayman theme. It worked, but I wanted something more flexible — a site that could grow with me as I move through graduate school. Specifically, I wanted a place to write blog posts alongside my CV without managing a complex web framework.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) checked every box:

- It renders plain Markdown (and Jupyter notebooks) into a polished website.
- It has built-in support for blog listings with categories and dates.
- It produces a static site that GitHub Pages can serve directly.
- The configuration is a single `_quarto.yml` file — no heavy toolchain required.

## Project Structure

The site is organized like this:

```
CVLandon_Teeter/
├── _quarto.yml          # Site configuration
├── index.qmd            # CV (front page)
├── blog.qmd             # Blog listing page
├── styles.css           # Custom styling
├── posts/
│   └── building-this-site/
│       └── index.qmd    # This blog post
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish.yml  # GitHub Actions deployment
```

## Step by Step

### 1. Converting the CV

My CV was already written in Markdown (`index.md`). I renamed it to `index.qmd` and added a YAML front-matter block so Quarto knows how to render it. I also cleaned up the formatting — replacing escaped hyphens with proper list items and adding section headers for the table of contents.

### 2. Adding Blog Support

Quarto makes blogs easy. I created a `blog.qmd` file with a `listing` directive that automatically discovers posts from the `posts/` directory. Each post lives in its own subfolder with an `index.qmd` file, which keeps things organized as the number of posts grows.

### 3. Configuring the Site

The `_quarto.yml` file ties everything together:

- **`project.type: website`** tells Quarto to build a full site with navigation.
- **`website.navbar`** adds links to the CV and Blog pages in the top navigation bar.
- **`format.html.theme: cosmo`** applies a clean Bootstrap theme.

### 4. Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

I wrote a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) that:

1. Triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
2. Installs Quarto in the CI environment.
3. Runs `quarto render` to build the site.
4. Deploys the rendered output to GitHub Pages using the `actions/deploy-pages` action.

This means every time I push a change — whether it is an update to my CV or a new blog post — the site rebuilds and deploys automatically.

## What is Next

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I plan to use this blog to document my graduate research, share notes on papers I am reading, and write about tools and techniques I pick up along the way. Stay tuned!
